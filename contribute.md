# Contribute Content

Each community wiki has a page that explains how you can get involved in that community.
That's the best way to get started as a content contributor.

If you'd like to request that a new wiki is set up, please [open an issue on GitHub][request-wiki].

# Contribute Money

Our server costs are low.  Really, really low.
Unless that changes dramatically, we don't need your money.

Chainwiki Network is powered by Wiki.js, an open source wiki platform.
If you find this resource valuable, please consider donating on [OpenCollective][contrib-oc] or [Patreon][contrib-pa]!

# Contribute Code

If you can, contribute code and bug reports to [the Wiki.js project on GitHub][contrib-gh].
