# Key Principles

We believe that a good community wiki MUST offer the following:

1. the wiki software must be open source—no dependencies on closed-source services
2. users can contribute using a Markdown or richtext editor—no wiki-specific language
3. users may log in using an existing account, such as GitHub, Discord, or Google
4. users may submit content without creating an account on the wiki, e.g. via GitHub PRs
5. robust admin tools—privileges, spam prevention, vandalism rollback—without third-party plugins
6. clean and modern interface on desktop and mobile
7. native support for multiple languages without third-party plugins
8. wiki software should be actively developed and improved
9. content must be stored outside the wiki under version control—no closed databases
