# Welcome to the Chainwiki Network
  
## Communities deserve great wikis.

A great wiki harnesses the energy and expertise of the community and provides a place for members to collaborate on a valuable resource for potential application developers, integrators, and investors.

## Most wiki platforms get in the way.

Most wiki platforms are hostile to users. Contributing content is difficult and even basic administrative tasks are complex and error-prone.  If anything goes wrong—a key contributor leaves, a spammer vandalizes the wiki, a server fails, or a service provider goes out of business—the shortcomings of most wiki platforms can make even basic recovery of the content nearly impossible.

## Chainwiki Network is here to help.

We are wiki and open content enthusiasts, and after years of exploring—and administering!—every alternative, we have a free software formula that works.
